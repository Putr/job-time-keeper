Job Time Keeper
===============

Small app written in JS to aid in time tracking the way I like it.

Deploy
------

* git clone
* copy/symlink nginx.prod.conf to nginx.conf and point nginx to it
* that's it!

NOTE: to add GA tracking to to: public/js/lib/gaa.js
(yes, not the optimal solution, but whatever)
